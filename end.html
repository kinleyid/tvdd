<h3>Interpretation of results:</h3>
Episodic future thinking is the process of mentally simulating the future. When we imagine the future, we use the brain’s autobiographical memory network to recombine elements from the past to construct events in the future. Some individuals tend to imagine the future in vivid detail while others do not. Recent research has shown that a technique derived from the cognitive interview (which probes eyewitnesses for memory details) can help people construct more detailed and specific descriptions of possible future events. Furthermore, past research has also shown that taking the time to imagine the future leads to more future-oriented decision-making, and that there is a correlation between the number of details generated and the degree to which decisions are future-oriented.
<h3>Hypothesis and Main Question:</h3>
The goal of this study is to investigate whether helping participants imagine future events in more detail (independent variable: episodic specificity/detail) will lead them to make more future-oriented decisions (dependent variable: willingness to wait for hypothetical future rewards). If so, this will establish that event-specific detail plays a causal role in decision-making. Furthermore, we would like to explore which other aspects of people’s imagination of the future change as a result of greater event-specific detail (e.g. vividness, visual perspective) and which of these are most strongly associated with future-oriented decision-making.
<h3>Why is this important to study?</h3>
This study will be used to investigate the effect of event-specific detail on decision-making. This will increase the body of research on this topic and add to our understanding of how memory and reward areas in the brain interact.</br>
